My answers for the question is based on Microsoft SQL Server. Some code may differ from MySQL.

Question #1 Generate a query to get the sum of the clicks of the marketing data​
SELECT SUM(clicks) AS sum_clicks
FROM marketing_data

# Use `SUM` function to get the sum of clicks from the marketing data.


Question #2 Generate a query to gather the sum of revenue by geo from the store_revenue table​
SELECT RIGHT(store_location, 2) AS geo, 
       SUM(revenue) AS sum_revenue
FROM store_revenue
GROUP BY store_location

# Use `RIGHT` function to get the geo, which are the last two characters from store location. Then group the data by the geo and sum up the revenue. 

Question #3 Merge these two datasets so we can see impressions, clicks, and revenue together by date and geo. Please ensure all records from each table are accounted for.



Question #4 In your opinion, what is the most efficient store and why?​
SELECT MKT.geo, (SUM(SR.revenue)/SUM(clicks)) AS revenue_per_click
FROM marketing_data AS MKT
INNER JOIN store_revenue AS SR
ON MKT.date = SR.date AND MKT.geo = RIGHT(SR.store_location, 2)
GROUP BY MKT.geo
ORDER BY revenue_per_click DESC

# I used the revenue per click as an indicator for the store's efficiency.
# I considered the store in CA as the most efficient store because it has the highest revenue per click.


Question #5 (Challenge) Generate a query to rank in order the top 10 revenue producing states​
SELECT TOP 10 RIGHT(store_location, 2) AS State, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM store_revenue
GROUP BY store_location
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC

# I used SELECT TOP 10 instead of LIMIT because I am using MS SQL Server.
